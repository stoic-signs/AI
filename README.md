## TicTacToe Game Agent
To launch the game, please open a terminal and type
`python3 tic-tac-toe.py`

Instructions are given on the game startup. Once the screen becomes white, you will be prompted to enter the board size, number to win and choice of algorithm you wish to play against.

You have the first move.  Be careful not to click inside the board area before the you enter all required inputs, otherwise you will lose a turn. Once you make your move, the Game Agent will make its move.

The game can also be tested using the tic.py file. It takes input in the format (row, col).
